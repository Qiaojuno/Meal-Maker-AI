1. Ingredient Categorization

  The current Ingredient model doesn't have a category field. How
  should I categorize ingredients into
  Vegetables/Carbs/Protein/Dairy?
  - Option A: Add a category field to the Ingredient model and have
  Gemini API return categories
  
  Yes, when the user scans the fridge, It should also categorize the foods in the JSON format. we may have to change the prompt for it. when it shows results, there should be a button for user to save results (instead of gnerate recipes). This will update the ingredients (essentially the fridge list). 
  
  - Option B: Create a categorization function that uses keywords
  (e.g., "chicken" → Protein, "spinach" → Vegetables)
  - Option C: Store categories separately in a new data structure

  2. Last Scan Date Storage

  Where should I store the "last updated" timestamp?
  - Option A: Create a new UserDefaults key lastScanDate
  I think this is the easiest implementation
  
  - Option B: Store it with the ingredients array
  - Option C: Use the most recent recipe's createdAt date as proxy

  3. Current Navigation Structure

  I see ContentView.swift has a custom nav bar with radial menu.
  Should I:
  - Option A: Replace the entire HomeTabView with this new design
  (keeping the custom bottom nav)
  
  yes. replace the entire homeview with this new design
  
  - Option B: Keep the existing CameraView flow and just update what
   shows when you're on the Home tab
  - Option C: Something else?

  4. Ingredient Detail View

  When tapping a category card (e.g., "Vegetables"), what should
  that screen show?
  - Just a list of ingredients in that category?
  - Any actions (edit, delete, add manually)?
  - Can you describe the expected UI?
  
  the category card should expand to show what's in the fridge in that category. I want to finish the homescreen first, and then add that implementation

  5. FAB vs Existing Radial Menu

  I see ContentView already has a radial menu with "Find Recipes"
  and "Update Fridge". Should I:
  - Option A: Replace that radial menu completely with the new FAB
  design
  
  yes! the update fridge is moved to the navigation bar, so don't worry about features being missing'
  
  - Option B: Keep both (seems redundant)
  - Option C: Integrate the FAB functionality into the existing
  radial menu

  6. Recipe Images

  The framework mentions "auto-generated or stock food photos".
  Should I:
  - Option A: Use SF Symbols as placeholder icons
  just use a grey card. We'll try to fetch images from an api later.'
  - Option B: Show a default food image placeholder
  - Option C: Try to fetch images from an API (which API?)
  - Option D: Leave blank/gray for now

  7. "New Recipes from Last Scan" Action

  When user taps this from the FAB menu, should it:
  - Generate NEW recipes (calling Gemini API again with same
  ingredients)?
  - Or just navigate to the saved recipes list?
  
  it should generate new recipes. the user can then navigate to savd to see the saved ones

  Current Confidence: 7/10 - I understand the UI structure but need
  clarity on data flow and how this integrates with the existing
  navigation.
