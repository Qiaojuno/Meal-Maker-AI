## ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE - Missing App Entry Point

**Problem**: The file `Meal_Maker_AIApp.swift` was accidentally deleted during cleanup.

**Status**: ✅ Recreated at `/Users/nich/Desktop/Meal-Maker-AI/Meal Maker AI/Meal_Maker_AIApp.swift`

**Current Error**:
```
Undefined symbols for architecture arm64: "_main"
```

**Cause**: Xcode's file system sync hasn't picked up the recreated file yet.

---

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED

### Step 1: Close Xcode Completely
```bash
# Quit Xcode (Cmd + Q)
```

### Step 2: Verify App Entry File Exists
```bash
ls -la "/Users/nich/Desktop/Meal-Maker-AI/Meal Maker AI/Meal_Maker_AIApp.swift"
```

Should show:
```
-rw-r--r--  1 nich  staff  243 Oct  4 XX:XX Meal_Maker_AIApp.swift
```

### Step 3: Clean Derived Data
```bash
rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Meal_Maker_AI-*
```

### Step 4: Reopen Xcode
```bash
open "/Users/nich/Desktop/Meal-Maker-AI/Meal Maker AI.xcodeproj"
```

### Step 5: Wait for Indexing
- Let Xcode finish indexing (watch top bar)
- Xcode 16's file system sync should auto-detect the file

### Step 6: Clean and Build
```bash
# In Xcode:
Shift + Cmd + K  # Clean
Cmd + B          # Build
```

## 🔑 API Configuration

**Status**: ✅ Configured (Modern Xcode 16 Method)

Permissions are in **Build Settings** (NOT separate Info.plist):
- `GENERATE_INFOPLIST_FILE = YES`
- `INFOPLIST_KEY_NSCameraUsageDescription` = "We need access to your camera to scan your fridge contents and identify ingredients."
- `INFOPLIST_KEY_NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription` = "We need access to your photo library so you can select photos of your fridge."

**Gemini API Key**: Configured in `Resources/.env`
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyD3K3llXHluUU0UEeHuRoDsBvVbNuCJKrM
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Error: "Undefined symbols: _main"

**Cause**: Xcode file sync issue with recreated app file

**Solutions**:

1. **Clean Derived Data** (most reliable):
   ```bash
   rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Meal_Maker_AI-*
   ```

2. **Manual File Check in Xcode**:
   - Open Project Navigator
   - Look for `Meal_Maker_AIApp.swift` at root level
   - If missing: Right-click → Add Files → Select the file
   - Make sure "Add to targets: Meal Maker AI" is checked

3. **Verify File Contents**:
   ```swift
   import SwiftUI

   @main
   struct Meal_Maker_AIApp: App {
       var body: some Scene {
           WindowGroup {
               ContentView()
           }
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Nuclear Option**:
   - Close Xcode
   - Delete entire Xcode project
   - Recreate from scratch (don't do this unless desperate)

## ✅ Success Checklist

Before running:
- [ ] `Meal_Maker_AIApp.swift` exists in filesystem
- [ ] File visible in Xcode Project Navigator
- [ ] Derived Data cleaned
- [ ] Xcode indexing complete
- [ ] No red errors in Xcode navigator
- [ ] Build succeeds (Cmd + B)
- [ ] Camera permissions configured

## 🚀 Once Build Succeeds

1. **Select real iPhone as target** (camera needs device)
2. **Run app** (Cmd + R)
3. **Grant permissions**:
   - Camera access
   - Photo library access
4. **Test full flow**:
   - Take/choose photo
   - Review ingredients
   - Generate recipes
   - Save recipe
   - View in History tab

## 🎓 What We Fixed

### Issue #1: Duplicate Info.plist
- **Problem**: Xcode 16 auto-generating Info.plist conflicted with custom file
- **Solution**: Deleted physical Info.plist, used modern `INFOPLIST_KEY_` approach
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### Issue #2: Duplicate ContentView.swift
- **Problem**: Old SwiftData template file conflicting with new one
- **Solution**: Deleted old file at root, kept Views/ContentView.swift
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### Issue #3: Missing Item.swift
- **Problem**: Old SwiftData model no longer needed
- **Solution**: Deleted completely
- **Status**: ✅ Fixed

### Issue #4: Missing App Entry Point
- **Problem**: Meal_Maker_AIApp.swift accidentally deleted
- **Solution**: Recreated file with @main attribute
- **Status**: ⚠️ Needs Xcode sync
